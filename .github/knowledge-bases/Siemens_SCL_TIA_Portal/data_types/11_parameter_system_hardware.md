# 11 Parameter System Hardware

# Parameter types

| Parameter types |
|---|
Description

The
parameter types are data types for formal parameters that are
transferred to called blocks. A parameter type can also be a PLC data
type.

The following table shows the available parameter data types and their purpose:

| Parameter type | Length (bits) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TIMER | 16 | Is used to specify a timer that is used in the called code block. If you supply a formal parameter of the TIMER parameter type, the associated actual parameter must be a timer. Example: T1 |
| COUNTER | 16 | Is used to specify a counter that is used in the called code block. If you supply a formal parameter of the COUNTER parameter type, the associated actual parameter must be a counter. Example: C10 |
| BLOCK_FC | 16 | Is used to specify a block that is used as input in the called code block. The declaration of the parameter determines the block type (for example FB, FC, DB) that is to be used. If you supply a formal parameter of the BLOCK parameter type, specify a block address as the actual parameter. Example: DB3 |
| BLOCK_FB | 16 | |
| BLOCK_DB | 16 | |
| BLOCK_SDB | 16 | |

| Note Parameter type "Block_DB" to transfer an instance DB In LAD and FBD, you cannot enter the instance DB of a function block using an input of the data type "BLOCK_DB". Use a parameter instance instead. See also: Parameter instances |

System data types


# System data types

| System data types |
|---|
Description

The
system data types (SDT) are made available by the system and have a
predefined structure. The structure of a system data type consists of a
fixed number of components that can have various data types. It is not
possible to change the structure of a system data type.

System
data types can only be assigned to one another if they are of the same
type and their name matches. This also applies to PLC data types
generated by the system, such as IEC_Timer, etc.

The
system data types can only be used for specific instructions. The
following table shows the available system data types and their purpose:

Hardware data types


# Hardware data types (derived data types)

| Hardware data types (derived data types) |

Description

The hardware data types are made available by the CPU. The number of available hardware data types depends on the CPU.

Constants
of a specific hardware data type are stored based on the modules set in
the hardware configuration. When an instruction for controlling or
activating a configured module is inserted in the user program, the
available constants can be used for the parameters.
